This is Course Project for Coursera Course: Getting and Cleaning Data. 

The R script, 'run_analysis.R', does the following:

1. Combines the training and the test datasets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The end-product of this is in the "tidydata.txt"

A more detailed step-by-step is provided in "Codebook.md".
